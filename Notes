----------------Gradient Descent-------------

By minimizing this loss with respect to the network parameters, we can find configurations where the loss is at a minimum and 
the network is able to predict the correct labels with high accuracy. 

We find this minimum using a process called gradient descent.

------------Why BackPropogation---------------

For single layer networks, gradient descent is straightforward to implement. 

Training multilayer networks is done through backpropagation which is really just an application of the chain rule from calculus.

Mathematically, this is really just calculating the gradient of the loss with respect to the weights using the chain rule.
We update our weights using this gradient with some learning rate  ùõº .
